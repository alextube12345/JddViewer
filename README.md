A very light Javascript app to plot MORET 5 & SERPENT Geometries from a text input file.
This app also allow you to export the 3D modelisations into 3D files (.stl or .ply eg).

To use it, just download it and open "index.html" in your internet browser.

Don't hesitate to contact me for any problem.
